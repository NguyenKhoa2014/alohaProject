3- Lesson Learn
I made a mistake of coding right away and when something didnâ€™t work, it took me a long time to figure something out
I decided to use Sketch to roughly drafted a page with 6 sections, and some guidances for section names and other details. It really helped me and I am going to use this method moving forward
Really good learning experience with styling html from html tag, body tag to group contents together
Great practice with all the syntax that I learned from first week lessons
What I learn the most about project 1 is that I still have a lot to learn. At the same time, I really enjoy doing this and I am pretty sure that once I get better I will enjoy this way more
